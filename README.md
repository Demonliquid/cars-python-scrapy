# cars-python-scrapy

cars: client code.

python: languague used in project.

scrapy: main task.



## Context
Client needs to validate online car data.


Scrapy istead of Selenium because need of speed for lots of iterations and little javascript interaction.


## Used libraries

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install libraries.

```bash
pip install scrapy
```

## Readability

These all are different projects within the same job and do basically the same:
- For BMW or vindecoder
  - Read from a list of chassis.
  - Search chassis.
  - Results to csv.


## Goal
Validate as many chassis as possible, it doesn't have to be the whole list but should be enough to know if source data is real enough.
